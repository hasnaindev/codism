# Codism

[Codism](https://codism.netlify.app) is a [Codepen](https://codepen.com/) inspired coding playgound that lets you add and modify HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create in order to create cool stuff! You'll definitely find it handy if you just want to code something without needing to go create files and folders that end up being a mess.

## Fast & Robust

At this point, we're compiling everything, right inside the browser which makes the response super fast! You type something and as soon as you stop typing we update the view. This helps us keep things optimized, yet at the same time, fast and robust.

## Motivation

I'd like to make something clear. I've not created this in order to rival platforms like [Codepen](https://codepen.com/) etc. I've created this project purely for learning purposes. I've been interested in how online platforms like [Codepen](https://codepen.com/), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Algoexpert](https://algoexpert.com/) works and I've learned a lot since I started doing research and decided to go with this project.

## Development

You can fork this repo, clone it and what not. Simply run `npm install` to install the packages and then run `npm start` to start up the development server. This should also open up a browser for you with HMR etc working out of the box.

## Production

Run `npm run build` to create an optimized build and `npm run serve` to serve the build files in your browser.
